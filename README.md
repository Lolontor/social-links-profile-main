### What I learned

With this project, it was an amazing experience. I learnt to use the object-fit property in CSS to make the image for the social media card look attractive.

```css
img {
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3School, CSS Object-fit property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_object-fit.asp) - This helped me understand the object-fit property in css to format images.
